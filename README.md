# Job Application Tracker

## Overview

I've created this Job Application Tracker as a personal project to help manage and organise my job search more efficiently. Built with Next.js and Supabase, this web application provides me with a user-friendly interface for tracking job applications, including details such as company names, position titles, application dates and current status.

## Features

- Add new job applications
- View a list of all my job applications
- Edit existing job application details
- Delete job applications
- Add and manage notes for each application
- Filter and sort job applications
- Real-time updates using Supabase

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js with React
- Backend: Supabase
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React Context API

## Planned Improvements

As I continue to develop this project, here are some improvements I'm planning to implement:

1. **Enhanced State Management**: 
   - Implement a more robust state management solution using React Context API.
   - Create a centralised JobProvider to manage all job-related state and operations.

2. **Improved Data Fetching**:
   - Implement more efficient data fetching strategies, possibly using SWR or React Query.
   - Add pagination for better performance with a large number of job applications.

3. **Advanced Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add more advanced filtering options (e.g., by date range, status, company).
   - Implement custom sorting functionality.
4. **Data Visualisation**:
   - Add charts and graphs to visualise my application status, response rates, etc.

5. **Email Notifications**:
   - Implement email notifications for application deadlines and status updates.

6. **Offline Support**:
   - Implement offline support using service workers for a progressive web app experience.

7. **Integration with Job Boards**:
   - Add functionality to import job listings from popular job boards.

8. **Accessibility Improvements**:
    - Ensure the application is fully accessible and compliant with WCAG guidelines.

## Personal Learning Goals

This project serves as a practical application of my web development skills and a chance to learn new technologies. Through building and improving this application, I aim to:

- Deepen my understanding of React and Next.js
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL and Supabase for backend operations
- Improve my skills in state management and data fetching in React applications
- Enhance my knowledge of responsive design and accessibility in web applications
